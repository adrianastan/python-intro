        "**[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index#scrollTo=-Rh3-Vt9Nev9)** is an interactive programming environment for the Python language that runs directly in the browser, without requiring any configuration on the local machine. Colab provides access to computational resources, including graphical computing power (GPU), and facilitates code sharing and collaboration.  \n",
        "The only requirement for using Colab is that the user has a Google account. Created notebooks are automatically stored in Google Drive in a directory that is automatically generated and named `Colab Notebooks`.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is also important to note that when initializing a Colab session, a [temporary virtual machine](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) is allocated, in which saved data (such as files uploaded to the session or saved via code, except for the notebook itself) is deleted at the end of the session. To store data persistently, a [connection to Google Drive](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb) can be established, making its contents available in the notebook, allowing files to be uploaded and saved directly in Google Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Google Colab is an extension of [IPython](https://ipython.org/) (Interactive Python) and the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment. In this environment, code is structured into files called *notebooks* with the extension `*.ipynb`. A notebook contains one or more *execution cells*. An execution cell contains one or more lines of code that can be run individually. The execution order of the cells can be arbitrary, and the programmer can return and modify previous cells without affecting the overall state of the code or needing to rerun the entire notebook. However, cells dependent on a modified cell must be rerun for changes to take effect.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code cells share the same visibility domain or *namespace*. This means that defining a variable, function, or class, or importing a module in one cell makes it available to the rest of the cells in the current notebook. It is important to emphasize that in this case, cells should be executed sequentially, meaning that if we want to use a certain variable, function, class, or module, the cell containing its definition must be run before the cells that modify or use these code components.\n",
        "\n",
        "Between code cells, text cells can be inserted to provide explanatory notes related to the code. Text cells use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) notation but can be augmented with HTML or [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) notation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to its flexibility and ease of use, Google Colab has become the primary coding environment for the Python language, especially in applications related to artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithm development."
